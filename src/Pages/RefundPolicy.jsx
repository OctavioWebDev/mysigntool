          Due to the custom nature of many of our products,
          we are unable to offer refunds or accept returns for
          Custom Order Products once an order is placed. Buyers have a
          window of 4 hours post-purchase to request modifications to custom orders.

        <p className="max-w-[900px] text-center md:text-xl dark:text-gray-400">
          Given the handcrafted nature of our products, slight variations and
          discolourations may occur. These are not considered faults. Variations
          in colour due to screen and printer calibration are also acknowledged by
          the Buyer as part of the product's unique characteristics.

          Upon delivery, the Buyer should inspect the Goods and report any defects,

          acceptance of the Goods as is, meeting all standards of quality and specification.
